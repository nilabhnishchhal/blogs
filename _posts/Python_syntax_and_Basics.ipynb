    "## Basic Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the world of Python programming! In this chapter, we'll embark on a journey to explore the basics of Python syntax. Python, known for its simplicity and readability, is a great language to start your programming adventure. Let's dive in and learn through a story - the tale of Alice in DataLand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of a Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "In DataLand, everything starts with a script. A Python script is like a recipe that tells your computer what to do. Each line of the script is an instruction, a step in the recipe, that the Python interpreter reads and executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a simple Python script\n",
    "print(\"Hello, DataLand!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now let us is another simple script, which Calculates the area of a Triangle\n",
    "# If you run this script as it is, python may hiss at you (in form of some errors)\n",
    "# This will be more clear in the end of the section about variables\n",
    "\n",
    "area = 0.5 * base * height\n",
    "```\n",
    "The script (also called codes sometimes) in Python are read and executed from top to bottom, in an orderly fashion. The output of earlier script can be used in the upcoming lines. In the example above, we saw a simple script used to print text of our choice on the screen. We will write many more going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move forward, two very important points about Pyhton-\n",
    "1. Python is case sensitive. Therefore, `print()` and `PRINT()` are different, so is `Print()`.\n",
    "1. Python is cute 😊. You are going to love it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables: Holding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice starts her day in DataLand by collecting data. In Python, we store data in containers called variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 10\n",
    "height = 4.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `name` holds a string \"Alice\", `age` holds an integer 10, and `height` holds a float 4.5.\n",
    "You can call a variable by its name, and the value it holds will come as the output. We will use variables to do operations on them, and they will behave exactly as the value they hold. \n",
    "example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Guess the output for_fun\n",
    "for_fun = age + height\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now call the variable, for_fun, and see what value it returns. Ohh, I forgot to tell you how to call a variable. Just write its name and run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables are sensitive creatures. Particularly they are very touchy about their names. Therefore, there are few very important points you must be careful about, when you name a variable. Here's a summary of these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Naming Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Alphanumeric and Underscore**: Variable names must consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), or underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case Sensitivity**: Variable names are case-sensitive. This means that `myVariable`, `myvariable`, and `MyVariable` are all considered different variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Reserved Words**: Variable names cannot be the same as reserved words (also known as keywords) in Python. Reserved words are those that have a special meaning in Python syntax (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `import`, `return`, `def`, `try`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Special Characters**: Apart from the underscore, any other special characters (like @, #, %, &, etc.) are not allowed in variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Not Starting with an Underscore (Convention)**: While it's allowed, it's a convention not to start a variable name with an underscore, as these are often used for specific purposes (like indicating a variable is for internal use, or for naming methods in classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices and Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these rules, there are also some best practices and naming conventions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive Names**: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables. For example, `price` is better than `p`, and `user_age` is better than `ua`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Snake Case for Variables**: Python community prefers snake_case for variable names where words are lowercase and separated by underscores, e.g., `my_variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid Using Single Character**: Except for certain cases like loop indices or lambda functions, avoid using single characters like `x`, `y`, `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constants**: By convention, constants are defined using uppercase letters with underscores separating words, e.g., `MAX_SIZE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these rules and conventions ensures that your Python code is more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.\n",
    "Now when we have learnt all about the variables in Python, let us go back to calculating the Area of Triangle. \n",
    "\n",
    "To write a simple script to calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Python script that prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle and then calculates and prints the area:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python script to calculate the area of a triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input base and height of the triangle\n",
    "base = float(input(\"Enter the base of the triangle: \"))\n",
    "height = float(input(\"Enter the height of the triangle: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the area\n",
    "area = 0.5 * base * height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the area\n",
    "print(f\"The area of the triangle is {area}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script works as follows:\n",
    "1. It asks the user to input the base and height of the triangle.\n",
    "2. The inputs are converted to `float` to handle decimal values.\n",
    "3. The area is calculated using the formula.\n",
    "4. Finally, it prints out the area of the triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scripts or rather along with the scripts, we used some instructions and clarifications which started very conspicuously with a `#`. These are called `comments` in Python. Let us understand what is that now. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments: Notes to Self\n",
    "\n",
    "As Alice collects data, she takes notes. In Python, we write notes using comments. Comments start with a `#` and are ignored by Python. They're for humans, not machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "# Python will ignore this\n",
    "```\n",
    "Therefore, whenever you want to write something which you want only humans to read (and therefore not being executed by the python interpreter), write them as comments. Going forward, you will notice many statements will be written which start with `#`. These are to make the code more readable and easy to understand. These lines will be ignored by the python interpreter. \n",

    "## Data and Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types: Strings, Integers, and Floats\n",
    "As Alice wandered through the vibrant markets of DataLand, she marveled at the versatility of Data. They were like chameleons, changing forms effortlessly. Sometimes, Data appeared as simple numbers, like the cheerful `42` or the floating `3.14`, known in the land as Integers and Floats. Other times, they transformed into sequences of letters and words, like `\"Hello, DataLand!\"`, weaving tales as Strings. In DataLand, data comes in different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strings**: Textual data, wrapped in quotes. Quotes can be single quotes, or double. Both are same.\n",
    "- **Integers**: Whole numbers, without a decimal point.\n",
    "- **Floats**: Numbers with a decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# String\n",
    "favorite_book = \"DataLand Adventures\"\n",
    "favourite_language = 'Python'\n",
    "# Integer\n",
    "chapters = 5\n",
    "# Float\n",
    "rating = 4.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operations\n",
    "In the bustling town square, Alice observed the wizards known as Operations. They were the dynamic force, performing actions that kept the land lively and functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among them were the Arithmetic Operators, the most straightforward magicians, who helped villagers with their daily tasks - adding their coins with `+`, sharing their pies with `/`, or sometimes multiplying their harvest with `*`.\n",
    "Alice loves to play with numbers. Python makes it fun with arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition** (`+`): Adds two numbers.\n",
    "- **Subtraction** (`-`): Subtracts one number from another.\n",
    "- **Multiplication** (`*`): Multiplies two numbers.\n",
    "- **Division** (`/`): Divides one number by another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Arithmetic operations\n",
    "sum = 7 + 3  # 10\n",
    "difference = 7 - 3  # 4\n",
    "product = 7 * 3  # 21\n",
    "quotient = 7 / 3  # 2.333...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there were the Comparison Operators, the wise old judges of DataLand, who decided which number was greater with `>` and which was lesser with `<`, or sometimes just determined equality with `==`. Alice also compares data using comparison operations. These judges passed their judgement in only two words, `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equal to** (`==`): Checks if two values are equal.\n",
    "- **Not equal to** (`!=`): Checks if two values are not equal.\n",
    "- **Greater than** (`>`), **less than** (`<`), **greater than or equal to** (`>=`), **less than or equal to** (`<=`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Comparison operations\n",
    "is_equal = (7 == 3)  # False\n",
    "not_equal = (7 != 3)  # True\n",
    "greater_than = (7 > 3)  # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the real enchantment happened when the Assignment Operators stepped in, often seen binding a value to a name with `=`, or mysteriously increasing a value with `+=`, subtly altering the events in DataLand. This is what we saw in assigning values to the variable names in previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Binding a value to a name\n",
    "magic_number = 7\n",
    "alice_age = 12\n",
    "wonderland_location = \"Through the Looking Glass\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these lines, `magic_number` is given the value `7`, `alice_age` is set to `12`, and `wonderland_location` is named `\"Through the Looking Glass\"`. The name is always on the left of the assignement operator, and the value on the right. In Python, `=` is only for assignemnt, and thus `==` becomes the operator of equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thn there is Increment Assignment (`+=`). The `+=` operator is like a magical increment, adding more to what already exists, making things grow mysteriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Increasing a value mysteriously\n",
    "treasure_count = 10\n",
    "treasure_count += 5  # Now treasure_count is 15\n",
    "\n",
    "steps_to_castle = 100\n",
    "steps_to_castle += 20  # Now steps_to_castle is 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `treasure_count` starts at `10` and mysteriously grows to `15` after encountering `+= 5`. Similarly, `steps_to_castle` increases from `100` to `120`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And that concludes our first day in DataLand with Alice. Today, we learned about the basics of Python syntax, including how to write a script, use variables, make comments, understand data types, and perform basic operations. Stay tuned for more adventures as we delve deeper into the wonderful world of Python programming!"

Sometimes, decisions must be made, and paths must be repeated. This is where control structures come in, guiding the course of our story.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Flowchart of for Loop](flowcharts-for_loop.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For Loop Example\n",
    "for house_number in range(1, 6):  # This will repeat for house numbers 1 to 5\n",

    "\n",
    "![Flowchart of while Loop](flowcharts-while_loop.jpg)\n",
    "\n",

    "Here, Alice keeps walking (repeating the loop) until she has taken 10 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter of \"The tale of Alice in DataLand\", Alice learned to make decisions at crossroads with `if-else statements`, repeat her visits to the village houses with `for loops`, and continue her walk in the forest with `while loops`.

    "print(greet_alice)   # Outputs: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "print(greet_rabbit)  # Outputs: Hello, Rabbit!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Parameters: Optional Ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, Alice wants to have default ingredients in her spells. In Python, these are called default parameters.\n",
